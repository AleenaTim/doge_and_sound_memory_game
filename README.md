* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess
* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up/slows down depending on difficulty user has clicked
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn
* [x] Added difficulty modes (easy, medium, hard) Easy = 5 turns, Medium = 10 turns, Hard = 15 turns
